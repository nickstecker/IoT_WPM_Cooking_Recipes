# Lasercutter Case

Here you'll find an example case prepared as a SVG template for Mr Beam lasercutter. Make sure to consider the following aspects:

- All elements need to be converted into pathes (e.g. fonts; no pixel)
- Logical stencilling (e.g. no fall-through)
- Strokes (undependent of width, color or styles) are cutting lines
- Fillings are engraving areas (gray tone represent the strength)Graving only useful for massive material (such as wood)
- Max. work area: 450mm x 350mm. For this class: max 410mm x 280mm (nearly DinA3)
- Output format: SVG (1.1, no additional editing functionality, no layersâ€¦)
